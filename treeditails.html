   <div class="texttips">
    <h1>1. Site it right.</h1>
    <p>Starting a garden is just like real estate it's all about location. Place your garden in a part of your yard where you'll see it regularly (out of sight, out of mind definitely applies to gardening). That way, you'll be much more likely to spend time in it.</p>
    <h1>2. Follow the sun.</h1>
    
  <p>Misjudging sunlight is a common pitfall when you're first learning to garden. Pay attention to how sunlight plays through your yard before choosing a spot for your garden. Most edible plants, including many vegetables, herbs, and fruits, need at least 6 hours of sun in order to thrive.</p>
  <h1>3. Stay close to water.</h1>
  <p>One of the best gardening tips you'll ever get is to plan your new garden near a water source. Make sure you can run a hose to your garden site, so you don't have to lug water to it each time your plants get thirsty. The best way to tell if plants need watering is to push a finger an inch down into the soil (that's about one knuckle deep). If it's dry, it's time to water.</p>
  <h1>4. Start with great soil.</h1>
  <p>When starting a garden, one of the top pieces of advice is to invest in soil that is nutrient-rich and well-drained. Achieve this just-right blend by mixing 3 inches of Miracle-Gro® All Purpose Garden Soil into the top 6 to 8 inches of existing soil if you're planning to plant in the ground. If you're planting in a raised bed, use Miracle-Gro® Raised Bed Soil, which is the perfect weight and texture for raised bed growing.</p>

         <div class="align">
         <p >The word “Bon-sai” (often misspelled as bonzai or banzai) is a Japanese term which, literally translated, means “planted in a container”. This art form is derived from an ancient Chinese horticultural practice, part of which was then redeveloped under the influence of Japanese Zen Buddhism.

            It has been around for well over a thousand years. The ultimate goal of growing a Bonsai is to create a miniaturized but realistic representation of nature in the form of a tree. Bonsai are not genetically dwarfed plants, in fact, any tree species can be used to grow one.</p></div>

        <h1 class="text1">How To Care</h1>
       </div><br>
       <div class="care">
        <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;" class="mt-3"><b>Placement : </b></h3><br>
        <h5>Indoor Bonsai location</h5>
        <p class="align">In most houses the only place where an indoor Bonsai will do well is right at a South facing window, as lots of light is crucial for the health of your tree. When placed even just a few feet away from a window the light intensity will drop significantly, slowing down growth and ultimately killing your Bonsai.
            Indoor Bonsai are usually (sub)tropical tree species, like the Ficus or Carmona, which means they need a relatively high humidity as well. Placing the Bonsai on a humidity tray will help. Place indoor trees somewhere with a constant temperature throughout the day. Continue reading about Indoor Bonsai here, or use the Identify my Bonsai guide to determine your tree species. You'll need to know what tree species you have exactly to optimize its care.</p>
            <h5>Outdoor Bonsai location</h5>
            <p class="align">Depending on where you live, most trees need to be placed outside year-round. The annual cycle is crucial for the health of most trees; overprotecting your tree in the winter season for example will weaken your tree. Make sure to establish what tree species you have and look up the care guidelines here on our website.
                As a rule of thumb; place outdoor Bonsai at a bright spot with lots of light. If your summers are especially hot, providing afternoon shade will be beneficial for your trees. In winter you might need to protect your trees, read more about Overwintering here. Continue reading about outdoor species here, or use the Identify my Bonsai guide to determine your tree species.</p> <br>
                <h3  style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Watering Bonsai trees : </b></h3> <br>
                <h5>Water your trees when the soil gets slightly dry</h5>
                <p class="align">Be sure not to water your tree if the soil is still wet, but don't let the tree dry out either. As a beginner, use your fingers at about one centimeter deep, (0.4") to check the soil moisture. If it's slightly dry, go ahead and water your tree. This will become more obvious as you gain experience. You'll be able to see, rather than feel when your tree needs watering.</p>
                <h5>Never water on a routine</h5>
                <p class="align">Keep a close eye on your trees individually to determine when each one needs watering. Avoid watering all of your trees on a daily routine, until you know exactly what you are doing.</p>
                <h5>Use the right soil-mixture</h5>
                <p class="align">The soil-mixture greatly influences how often trees need to be watered. Most Bonsai trees thrive on a mixture of akadama, pumice, and lava rock in a ratio of ½ to ¼ to ¼. However, if you are not able to water regularly, you can use a mixture that retains more water by using more akadama or even using compost in your potting. Read the Bonsai soil mixtures article for more information</p>
                <h5>How to water Bonsai trees?</h5>
                <p class="align">When you've determined that the soil is slightly dry and the tree needs water, make sure to thoroughly soak the entire root system. Keep watering until water runs out of the bottom drainage holes, and possibly repeat the process a few minutes later.
                   Pour water from above using a watering can with a fine nozzle to prevent the soil from being washed away. If you keep your Bonsai indoors, you can place your tree in your kitchen sink and water the tree thoroughly, before placing it back. The best water you can use is rainwater because it doesn't contain any added chemicals, but when this is not readily available there is no problem in using normal tap water. There are some good Automated Bonsai Watering systems out there, but they are quite costly.</p><br>
                   <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Fertilizing</b></h3><br>
                   <h5>The basic components of fertilizer</h5>
                   <p class="align">There are three basic elements in any fertilizer; Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium (NPK.) Nitrogen increases the growth of the leaves and stems or the growth above ground. Phosphorus contributes to healthy root growth and the growth of fruits and flowers. Potassium enhances overall plant health. Growers often use different ratios of NPK for different trees and at different times of the year. However, experts are increasingly recommending using the same NPK ratio throughout the Bonsai growth cycle. Apart from the three macronutrients (NPK), fertilizers can also include a range of micronutrients like Iron, Manganese, Boron, Molybdenum, Zinc, and Copper.</p>
                   <h3>When should I apply fertilizer?</h3>
                   <p class="align">Most Bonsai trees should be fertilized during the entire growing season; early spring through mid-fall. Older and more mature trees are often fertilized less frequently, depending on the species, time of year, stage of development, and health of the tree. Indoor trees can be fertilized all year round. Check our care guides for specific information about when to fertilize each specific tree species.</p>
                   <h3>Which fertilizer to choose?</h3>
                   <p class="align">t is important to choose the right fertilizer for your Bonsai plants and apply the right quantities. For outdoor Bonsai we recommend using a relatively high Nitrogen content fertilizer like NPK 10:6:6. in spring, a more balanced fertilizer like NPK 6:6:6 is more optimal for summertime, and a low Nitrogen fertilizer like NPK 3:6:6 for autumn. More and more, experts are favoring using a balanced fertilizer throughout the growing season, and slowly decreasing the amount applied towards the end of the growing season.

                    The fertilizer you choose should also depend on the developmental stage of your trees. Our goal for a Bonsai in early development is strong growth, hence we need a relatively strong fertilizer. For a Bonsai in late development we desire balanced growth for fine ramification, and a balanced fertilizer would be recommended.</p>

         <p >A fruit tree is a tree which bears fruit that is consumed or used by animals and humans — all trees that are flowering plants produce fruit, which are the ripened ovaries of flowers containing one or more seeds. 
            With your own fruit trees you know exactly what you’re getting: no sprays, no wax, no chemicals. And you can enjoy a steady supply of fruit for much of the year.

       </div><br>
       <div class="care">
        <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;" class="mt-3"><b> Prune : </b></h3><br>
        <p class="align">Regular pruning helps trees live longer, happier lives. While most fruit tree pruning happens in the late winter, some can be done in the summer, too. The National Gardening Association (NGA) recommends pruning any new branches that are growing from the base of the tree (suckers) or straight up from horizontal branches (water sprouts) before mid-summer. These branches won't form fruits and will usually crowd other branches, which increases the incidence of disease and insect problems.</p>
        <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;" class="mt-3"><b> Inspect Often : </b></h3><br>
                
                <p class="align">Regularly check your tree’s branches, bark, leaves and the developing fruits for signs of insects or disease. If you find something, apply the appropriate organic controls to remedy the problem.</p>
                <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;" class="mt-3"><b>Keep Them Watered : </b></h3><br> 
                <p class="align">It’s best to water deeply and infrequently, rather than shallowly and frequently, according to the NGA. For trees on sandy soils, water every one to two weeks with enough water to sink down 2 feet. On clay soils, water every two to three weeks.
                    Obviously, the frequency will depend on weather conditions: water less during rainy times and more during droughts.</p>
                    <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;" class="mt-3"><b>Mulching and Fertilizing</b></h3><br> 
                <p class="align">Organic mulch will help conserve water, provide organic matter to the topsoil, control weeds and ultimately help your tree produce better results. The NGA recommends spreading at 2- to 3-inch layer of mulch over the root zone and a few inches away from the trunk.
                    As for fertilizing, the amount you do will depend on how well the tree is growing. Adding compost around the base of young fruit trees (again, a few inches away from the trunk) and at the drip line of older trees, is always a good practice, the NGA says.</p>
                    <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;" class="mt-3"><b>Thin it Out </b></h3><br>
                <p class="align">Your tree will likely produce more fruit that the tree itself can support. Thinning fruits eliminates diseased or insect-infested fruits, reduces fruit load, prevents branches from breaking under excessive weight, and prevents alternate year bearing which is common on some fruit trees varieties, the NGA states.
                    Definitely leave the largest and healthiest looking fruit on the tree, and wait until after the natural drop that every fruit tree experiences.</p><br>
                   <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Spread the Branches</b></h3><br>
                   <p class="align">For young trees, you can encourage strong branch or crotch angles be spreading branches. According to the Urban Tree Foundation, wide-angled branch attachments are stronger. You can use wooden spreaders placed between narrow-angled branches to slowly force them apart, or take fishing line with weights attached and tie them to ends of smaller branches needing to grow more horizontally.
                    Proper care of your fruit trees will help them live longer and produce better, bigger fruits. If you have questions or want an arborist to take a look at your tree, contact Precision Landscape & Tree.</p></div>

                        <p class="align">n the summer season, you need to water your flowers at least once every day. Plants lose a lot of water during this season and they can wither or have stunted growth if they are not well watered. The other seasons are pretty cool and wet, and you can water your flowers twice a week.

                          When it comes to determining the amount of water to use on your garden, you need to consider the species of the flowers and their water requirements. Other factors that you can consider are the type of soil in your garden and the amount of rainfall in your area.</p>
                          <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;" class="mt-3"><b>Apply Appropriate Fertilizers </b></h3><br>
                            <p class="align">Garden soils lose fertility with time, subjecting plants to inadequate nutrients. When you notice signs of low soil fertility in your garden, you need to immediately apply appropriate fertilizers to your flowers.The best fertilizers for flowers are water-soluble or liquid ones. Some fertilizers can scorch plants when used incorrectly. For example, when high amounts are used or when applied at the wrong time. To avoid this problem, you need to follow the manufacturer's directions for the fertilizer.</p> <br>

                                <p class="align">Weeds compete for resources with useful plants and can harbor pests and diseases. In order to get the best from your flowers, you need to remove any weeds that grow in your gardenIf you are growing flowers in a smaller garden or using pots and vases, you can control weeds by just uprooting them. For a larger garden, you need to use garden tools like a hoe and pick, and you can weed after every week.</p>
                                <h3 style="text-decoration:underline;" class="mt-3"><b>Provide Your Plants With Enough Sunlight </b></h3><br>
                                <p class="align">Sunlight is the source of energy in plants, and so you need to ensure that your flowers are getting enough of it. Some flowers need many hours of sunlight every day while others, like the indoors, need just a few hours. So you need to know the light requirements of your plants in order to provide them with enough light.</p>
                                <h3  style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Prevent and Control Pests</b></h3> <br>
                                <p class="align">Pests can easily kill flower plants, so it is important to prevent them from attacking your garden. You can prevent some pests by keeping your garden free from weeds and refuse. You can prevent other pests by installing barriers and traps. Some pests that you should be aware of include bugs, mites, aphids, whiteflies, and gnats.

                                  If your plants are accidentally attacked by pests, you need to use appropriate pesticides to kill the harmful organisms. You can also eradicate the highly affected plants to control the spread of pests.</p>
                                  <h3  style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>Prevent and Control Diseases</b></h3> <br>
                                <p class="align">Like pests, diseases are quite harmful to flowers. Most plant diseases are caused by fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Some diseases that you should be aware of include anthracnose, bacterial leaf spot, ovulinia petal blight, and white rust.
                                  You can prevent fungal diseases by avoiding excessive use of water in your garden, pots, or vases. On the other hand, you can prevent bacterial and viral diseases by using clean weeding and pruning tools.</p><br>

                                   <p class="align">Some animals, like the herbivores, can destroy flower gardens by feeding on the foliage. Other animals like dogs and cats can also be destructive on garden plants.

                                    The best way to protect your garden from animals is to install a barrier. You can use a barrier like a wire fence which provides maximum protection and still keeps the garden visible.</p>
                                    <h3  style="text-decoration:underline;"><b> Pinch and Prune Your Plants</b></h3> <br>
                                   <p class="align">In the world of plant care, pinching is the process of removing stem tips to encourage lateral growth and promote good shape. It is recommended to pinch back your plants to increase branching and promote the formation of more flowers.</p>

                                   <p class="align">
                                    Thinning is the process of removing excess plants to create room for the growth of the remaining plants. If your garden lacks enough resources for all the flowers, you can carry out this process.
